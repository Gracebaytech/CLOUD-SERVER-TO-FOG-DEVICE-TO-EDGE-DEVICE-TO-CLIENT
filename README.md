This project aims to evaluate the efficiency and performance of Edge, Fog, and Cloud computing architecture in the context of video streaming.
 # Video Streaming Performance Analysis in Edge, Fog, and Cloud Computing Architectures

## Overview

This project aims to analyze the performance of video streaming in various computing architectures, including edge, fog, and cloud setups. The network system consists of interconnected components, such as cloud servers, fog devices, edge routers, and client PCs, which enable the transmission and analysis of video data.

## System Setup

The network architecture is designed with specific configurations for cloud, fog, and edge devices. Virtual machines are set up using VMware Workstation, providing the necessary memory, processor, and disk space to run the simulation effectively.

## Metrics Analysis

Throughput, latency, and lag data are collected and processed for different video quality levels, including low, medium, and high qualities. Python scripts are used to generate random data for lag length and ratio, providing insights into the network's performance under various conditions.

## Project Scripts

The repository contains Python scripts for server setup, client retrieval, and video processing. OpenCV is utilized for video analysis, and Wireshark is employed for network monitoring. The scripts help in gathering data and assessing the efficiency of the video streaming setup.

## Installation

To replicate the project setup, follow the installation instructions provided in the repository. Make sure to have GNS3, GNS3 VM, VMware Workstation, Wireshark, FFmpeg, and other required tools installed on your system.
